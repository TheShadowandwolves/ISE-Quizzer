#Quiz 9

$ In the improvement of Anti-Aliasing, it will be correct in terms of Responsibility Driven Design (RDD), to put the beam of ray's creation in the Camera class
@ True*
@ False

$ Which of the FOLLOWING methods of generating points in a target area for a ray beam (super-sampling pattern) is the simplest to implement?
@ Rotated grid
@ Jittered
@ Stochastic / Random grid*
@ All the methods in the other sections are similar in their simplicity
@ Poisson disc

$ In this course, we presented a grid method for the creation of the beam of rays. In "real life" (without taking into account acceleration improvements) how many rays would be used in the beam to create a final image?
@ From 17x17 to 33x33*
@ 3x3
@ 14x14
@ 9x9
@ 2x2

$ In this course, we presented a grid method for the creation of the beam of rays. In "real life" (without taking into account acceleration improvements) how many rays would be used in the beam to create a final image?
@ 3x3
@ 65x65*
@ 9x9
@ 2x2
@ 10x10

$ Which of the following statements is “incorrect” regarding Depth of Field image improvement?
@ It is recommended to place the aperture on the camera
@ The purpose of the improvement is to create an entire image in focus*
@ Aperture size affects the distance range of focus of the improvement (the range of distances where the bodies will be seen in focus)
@ Focal distance is defined on the ray passes through the view plane
@ The focal point is always on the focal plane

$ In the implementation of the image improvement of soft shadows, we will perform a "same side" test (ln * vn > 0) on the central shadow ray, and if the test is negative, we will not have to create a beam of shading rays at all
@ True
@ False*

$ When implementing the Soft Shadows improvement, we need to make changes in the code beside the required changes in the renderer package
@ True*
@ False

$ When activating the Depth of Field improvement in our framework, activating simultaneously the Anti-Aliasing improvement will not be useful because all curves will be smoothed anyway by Depth of Field
@ True
@ False*

$ The purpose of Anti-Aliasing improvement is to solve the hard shadows problem
@ True
@ False*

$ In which of the image improvements have we learned using a beam of rays (super-sampling), the beam is created from a source surface to a target point and not from a source point to a target surface?
@ Soft Shadows
@ Depth of Field*
@ Anti-Aliasing
@ Blur/Diffuse Glass
@ Glossy Surface

$ In which of the image improvements we’ve studied which use a beam of rays (super-sampling) will require a change in the PointLight class?
@ Anti-Aliasing
@ Glossy Surface and Blur/Diffuse Glass
@ Depth of Field
@ Soft Shadows*
@ No change to the PointLight class is required for any such improvement

$ When we improved the picture by adding the Blur Glass & Glossy Surface algorithms, in order to create the beam of rays, we used a target area (BlackBoard) that was created on the basis of existing data and with that, we only added a target area size (like a radius or the size of the side of the rectangle/square) similar to the soft shadows improvement
@ True
@ False*

$ Which of the following methods of creating points in a target area for a ray beam (super-sampling) is the best in terms of image quality and without side effects (regardless of performance)?
@ Rotated grid
@ Jittered
@ Stochastic / Random grid
@ Grid
@ Poisson disc*

$ In the Soft Shadows improvement, it will be correct in terms of Responsibility Driven Design (RDD) to put the beam of rays creation in the Camera class
@ True
@ False*

$ Which of the problems is not solved by using a beam of rays (super sampling) instead of a single ray?
@ The boundaries of a shadow are too sharp
@ Boundaries between the objects look jagged (like a saw)
@ All objects are seen in focus (in focus) - both near and far
@ Glasses and mirrors look too clean/perfect
@ All shadows are full even though there are partially transparent objects in the image*

$ The purpose of the Anti-Aliasing improvement is to solve the jagged edges problem
@ True*
@ False

$ Which of the image improvements we learned does not calculate the average of the color of the rays in the beam?
@ Anti-Aliasing
@ Glossy Surface and Blur/Diffuse Glass
@ No change in the Material class is required for any such improvement
@ Soft Shadows*
@ Depth of Field

$ What is a correct statement regarding Soft Shadows improvement?
@ The target area for Spot Light may appear from the point of intersection in the form of an ellipse*
@ The improvement is relevant for all the external light bodies we studied (Point, Spot and Directional)
@ The size of the target area of the improvement depends in the material of the body for which we calculate the shadow effect
@ The target area of the improvement for point light is recommended to be defined as a sphere (that is, in the shape of a 3D body and not flat)
@ The improvement will not require us to make changes in the calcLocalEffect method or its auxiliary methods (transparency for example)

$ Which of the following methods of creating points in a target area for a ray beam (super-sampling) is relatively good in terms of image quality and without side effects and also relatively good in performance (in terms of speed)?
@ Stochastic / Random
@ Grid
@ Poisson disc
@ Jittered*
@ Rotated grid
